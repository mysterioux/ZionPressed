====================

Usage
-----

You have to put the entire folder in your wp-content WordPress theme folder.


If you would edit the source code, you can go to the header.php file, looking for things like


``` html
<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="lib/other">
<script src="other.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Versioning
----------

Of course I would be making more modifications to this. But feel free to fork this project. I'd also look forward to pull requests.
